Bonus Assignment: Master-Level Web Application

This is my attempt at a master level website. I faced many challenges while trying to completing this assignment, firstly I could not get modules working. None of the import or export functions were working, so I decided to remove the modules and it made things much simpler. The biggest issue I faced was the API's. I ended up finding a free API for weather called Open-Meteo API, although there is a daily limit for requests. I tried to get another news API but I was not able to get it working, so I removed it. This was a difficult assignment for me, but I gave it a shot.
